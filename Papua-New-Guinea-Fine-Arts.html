                <p><strong>Source:</strong> Forage for reddish or yellowish ochre clay. Good places to look are riverbeds, exposed earth, or building sites.</p>

                <p><strong>Preparation:</strong><br>
                Crush the clay into a fine powder with a stone mortar and pestle or by grinding it between two large, flat rocks.<br>
                Use a sieve to remove any large clumps or debris.<br>
                Continue grinding and sifting until you have a soft, even powder.</p>

                <p><strong>White</strong><br>
                Source: White clay, crushed eggshells, or chalk. In PNG, white paint is sometimes made from crushed marine shells.</p>

                <p><strong>Preparation:</strong><br>
                Grind your chosen material into a fine powder.<br>
                For eggshells, bake the shells first to make them brittle before grinding.</p>

                <p><strong>Black</strong><br>
                Source: Charcoal from burnt wood, coconut shells, or burnt cork. Traditionally, soot from ceremonial houses was used.</p>

                <p><strong>Preparation:</strong><br>
                Collect charcoal and crush it into a fine powder.<br>
                Mix a pinch of the powder with a drop of water to test its color.<br>
                Grind and sift until it is an extremely fine, smooth powder.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Create your binder</h3>
                <p>A binder is the medium that holds the pigment together and helps the paint adhere to the skin.</p>

                <p><strong>Oil-based binder (for a glossy finish)</strong><br>
                Melt animal fat or render a plant oil: Heat a small amount of oil, such as coconut oil, over low heat until it is a liquid. In traditional PNG, oils from the tigaso tree or pig fat are used.</p>

                <p>Add your pigment: Slowly mix the powdered pigment into the warm oil, stirring continuously.</p>

                <p>Cool and store: Allow the mixture to cool and thicken before use.</p>

                <p><strong>Water-based binder (for a matte finish)</strong><br>
                Make a flour or clay paste: Mix 1 part flour or white clay with 1 part water.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Mix the paint and apply</h3>
                <p>Add pigment to binder: Mix your prepared pigments with your chosen binder in a small container.<br>
                Grind for smoothness: Use a palette knife or your fingers to thoroughly mix and grind the paste.<br>
                Test the paint: Before applying to your body, do a test patch on your arm.<br>
                Create your designs: Use your fingers or a simple tool like a twig to apply the paint to the skin.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Add shine (optional)</h3>
                <p>For an extra glossy, luminous finish, you can rub additional vegetable oil, like coconut oil, over the painted areas once the paint has dried. This creates the flash or glow that is often associated with traditional bilas and symbolizes health and power.</p>
